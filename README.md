# Rubyn Code

**Ruby & Rails agentic coding assistant — right in your editor.**

Refactor controllers, generate idiomatic RSpec, catch N+1 queries, review PRs, and build entire features — all context-aware with your schema, routes, and specs.

<!-- TODO: GIF — Rubyn Code chat panel in action, refactoring a controller -->

## Quick Start

1. **Install the gem**
   ```bash
   gem install rubyn-code
   rubyn-code --setup
   ```

2. **Install this extension** from the VS Code Marketplace

3. **Open a Rails project** and press `Cmd+Shift+R` to start coding with Rubyn

That's it. Rubyn activates automatically when it detects Ruby files or a Gemfile.

## Features

### Chat Panel

Converse with an agentic assistant that reads your codebase, writes code, runs specs, and learns from every session. Streaming responses show progress in real time.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — Chat panel with streaming response -->

### Inline Diffs

Code changes appear as reviewable inline diffs. Accept or reject each change before it hits your files.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — Inline diff in the editor -->

### Context-Aware Refactoring

Select code and run **Refactor Selection** (`Cmd+Shift+E`). Rubyn automatically pulls in related models, routes, specs, and services to produce informed refactors.

### Spec Generation

Run **Generate Specs** on any file. Rubyn reads the implementation, checks existing factories, and writes thorough RSpec coverage with edge cases.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — Generated spec file -->

### PR Review

Run **Review PR** to diff your branch against `main` (or any base branch). Get severity-rated feedback: critical issues, warnings, suggestions, and nitpicks.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — PR review output -->

### Explain Code

Select unfamiliar code and run **Explain Code** for a plain-language breakdown of what it does, why, and any patterns or issues to watch for.

### Status Bar

See the agent's current state (idle, thinking, executing) and running session cost at a glance.

### Tool Approval Flow

Every tool call (file read, file write, shell command) requires your approval before executing. Or enable **YOLO mode** to auto-approve everything for uninterrupted flow.
